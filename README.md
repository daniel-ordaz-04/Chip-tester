# Chip-tester
As a technology person we know that sometimes we have a bad time trying to find the error in an entire circuit.
Sometimes the components of the circuits don't even work and we don't know.

"Chip tester" is a set of libraries in arduino to test the functionality of the selected integrated circuit. The code is explained in the .cpp and .h archives.
